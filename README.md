A collection of raw text from various Greek dialects. Contains data from the following dialects:
- Cypriot Greek

The repository contains data collected from the web and other textual resources (blogs, websites, theatrical plays among other things). The folder SMG_CG contains twitter data from Standard Modern Greek and Cypriot that have been originally collected by Hanna Sababa for her project A Classifier to Distinguish Between Cypriot Greek and Standard Modern Greek. Mr Sfakianakis is thanked from providing us with his Cretan translations of a number of Ancient Greek tragedies and comedies.
